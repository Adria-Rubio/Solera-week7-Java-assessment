Results of the api integration test:
[[file:api-integration-test-results.png]]

* User history
As a product owner, I need a Java application that allows me to:
- Connect to the hpel database.
- Add information to a custom named table using a rest service (post action).
- Retrieve the information of the custom named table using a rest service (get action).

* pre-conditions:
1. You need to create a custom named table into the hpel DB with your name using the base script listed below, for example *taniaVillegasTable* table.
2. You need to create a Java application (Rest service) to populate the table created in the previous step. *Important: You cannot populate the table with any other method, for example: sql query.*
3. Use the next parameters to connect the app to the azure database.

*DON'T drop or modify any other table than the one you will create using your name*

** /Initial script for table/
#+begin_src sql
USE hpel_july_2022;
SET ANSI_NULLS ON

GO
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[myNameTable](
[id] [int] NULL,
[firstName] [varchar](25) NULL,
[lastName] [varchar](25) NULL,
[phoneNumber] [varchar](20) NULL,
[email] [varchar](25) NULL
) ON [PRIMARY]
GO
#+end_src

* Acceptance criteria
 - Postman or any API consumer tool, with a screenshot of the evidence of your post calls to fill out your table.
 - Java application execution screenshot with the information from your table (localhost site using get action).

* Log
** SQL Server
*Attention. SQL Server installation sucks. I'm using MySQL.*

1. I installed the SQL Server Management Studio with the command ~winget install Microsoft.SQLServerManagementStudio~.
2. Realized I don't have permissions
3. Proceed to install SQL server locally
4. Try ~sqlcmd -S DESKTOP-V0PO5TQ -E~
5. I don't like this. Search a way to use powershell to interact with the database. ~Install-Module -Name SqlServer~

Source of the next notes: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/powershell/sql-server-powershell?view=sql-server-ver16
On powershell scripts, use ~Import-Module -Name SqlServer~. The module is installed at ~%ProgramFiles%\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\SqlServer~. No need to update the ~$env:PSModulePath~ variable.

** MySQL
Run 'mysqld --standalone' or 'mysqld --console' to start the Database, or run following command as administrator to register MySQL as a service. See: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/windows-start-service.html
#+begin_src shell
mysqld --install MySQL --defaults-file="C:\Users\adria.rubio\scoop\apps\mysql\current\my.ini"
#+end_src

To stop and/or delete the Service run 'sc stop MySQL' and 'sc delete MySQL'.
** Fuck it i'm using H2
The title, lol.
